# AddEngine (Addenity Engine AKA ADE)

## Functionality
  1. EngineUtilies
      * HexLoop
      * 2D Vectors
      * Linear Algebra
  2. Tile Map
      * Function TileMap(2dArray){
              // Converts 2dArray to Hexadecimals and loops through with bitwise logic
              // Write in a file ex: map.txt
        }
  3. Rendering
      * Graphics
        * Console
        * Web
        * Software
      * Counter/Timer
        * Physics
      * Collision
      * Audio (Last priority)
  4. Controller
      * Configuration possibilities to have access to exclusive controls
      
## Goal
  * Compatible with any graphics system (Console, 2D Web, 2D App) 
  * Physics/Gravity/Velocity properly configurable according to game genre (1D/2D ex: Tetris/Megaman/Pacman)
  * Collision textures (Bouncy, slippery to rugged) AKA Friction
  * Transitional movement
